# Final Project Part I

## High-level summary
California invests very little in its children relative to other states and nations - but that hasn't always been the case. I want to visualize the steady decline in budget dollars allocated towards K-12 education. More importantly, I hope to show how this decline in funding has impacted outcomes for students in our state. 

## Project structure
 - K12-Funding has decreased
 - Show impact of 2008 recession
 - Education outcomes (standardized test scores) have suffered
 - Access to enrichment programs has worsened
 - How this contributes to growing income inequality & CA exodus

## Initial sketches
- Coming soon

## The data
- Trends in general state spending, available on the [California Legislative Analyst Office's (LAO) website](https://lao.ca.gov/PolicyAreas/state-budget/historical-data)
- The 2020 (and previous years) California Children's Report Card, published by [Children Now] (https://www.childrennow.org/portfolio-posts/20-report-card/)
