## About me
Hello there! My name is Emily Reece, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a second year (ish) student in the Heinz MS Public Policy Management Data Analytics program. I say "ish" because I took a leave from school last fall, so I will graduate in December of this year as opposed to May. I am from [Murrieta, California](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Murrieta,+CA/@33.5775832,-117.2684816,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80db7d3fc502f2f1:0x12d42ef99dd4ed8f!8m2!3d33.5539143!4d-117.2139232). I'm the middle child of three sisters, I have a cat named Luna, and I enjoy playing soccer and running in my freetime. And baking ALL THE COOKIES.

Prior to coming to Heinz, I earned a BA in political science from UC Berkeley. Upon graduating in 2016, I began work at a policy advocacy nonprofit based out of Oakland, CA called [Children Now](https://www.childrennow.org/), where I started as an executive assistant and eventually became the database (Salesforce) administrator for [The Children's Movement](https://www.childrennow.org/thechildrensmovement/) team. I had always been interested in pursuing a public policy degree. Joining The Children's Movement team expanded my interests into the world of data analytics. My role as database administrator opened my eyes to the disparities between how the private and public sectors leverage data and technology in decision-making. I was blown away by the sophisticated ways that even small companies use tools like Salesforce and Pardot to increase their bottom line, while many government agencies are still dependent on paper forms for gathering information about the people they serve. My interest in public policy and my desire to shrink the data/tech gap between the private and public sectors is what eventually led me to the MSPPM-DA program at Heinz. Once I finish my program, I plan to work with Deloitte in their Government & Public Sector practice, based out of Sacramento, CA. 

## What I hope to learn

I took a leave last fall to 1) take a break from the stress that a lot of students were experiencing from switching to online learning and; 2) accept a job offer from the State of Colorado. I served in the Office of Governor Jared Polis as Deputy Coordinator for COVID-19 Response & Recovery from June through December. The job really helped me prioritize what I want to learn in my remaining two semesters at Heinz. While the position did not require much technical or analytics work on my part, I was tasked with communicating COVID-19 data to a wide range of stakeholders. In my experience at Heinz, communication and management are often brushed off as less valuable/important skills relative to understanding certain programming languages or modeling techniques. My role at the State of Colorado showed me that those "hard" skills are useless if you cannot clearly communicate information to a wide variety of audiences. I'm hoping this course, Telling Stories with Data, will help me become a better data communicator and help me be better explain *why* communication is such an important skill when it comes to data analysis and public policy.
