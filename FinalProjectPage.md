# Final Project Main Page

Due March 17  

## The final project for the *Telling Stories With Data* course was divided into three parts. 

[Part I](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/FinalProjectPart1.html) involved drafting a project outline and a high-level summary of the project, 
as well as describing the method and medium I planned to use to create the final project. Part I also includes a short description of data sources, an explanation of how 
I planned on using that data, and links to the sources themselves. You can also check out Part I for some preliminary sketches of the project.

In [Part II](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/FinalProjectPart2.html) of the project, I created a wireframe of the story in Shorthand and gathered user feedback 
on that wireframe. The Part II page has a link to the wireframe, my script and findings from user interviews, as well as a list of changes I planned to make based on those findings.

Lastly, [Part III](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/FinalProjectPart3.html) contains a few paragraphs reflecting on the changes I made between Part II and Part II of the project.
These reflections touch on identified audience, narrowing the focus of the story, design decisions, as well as what I've learned from working on this project and the overall course. Check out the
Part III page to find the link to the final version of the project, or see the directory below.
