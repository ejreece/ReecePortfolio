All of the charts above visualize the same dataset sourced from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Each chart displays the general government debt-to-GDP ratio for various countries. The first chart compares the ratio within a single year, 2016. The second and third charts compare the ratio across a 10 year period (1995-2015). As mentioned in the footer of each visual, general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. You can learn more about the debt-to-GDP ratio by visiting the [OECD website](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)  
  
All three visualizations have different strengths. The first chart is ideal for highlighting how different countries compare when it comes to their debt-to-GDP ratio. This chart is less useful if one wants to observe how the ratio has changed within various countries *overtime*. The second chart is best used for visualizing overtime trends in debt-to-GDP ratio in various countries. With chart #2, it's still possible to compare the ratios of different countries, however, chart #1 allows for more direct comparisons. In other words, chart #1 is the better option for an audience aiming to guess the numerical difference between ratios of different countries. The last chart provides a more focused or filtered visualization of the same dataset. Filtering by country reduces the amount of information presented at once, allowing the audience to process the visualization more quickly. Nevertheless, the third chart makes it difficult to compare ratio trends across different countries, meaning this chart is ideal for an audience hoping to focus on the debt-to-GDP ratio within one country at a time.
