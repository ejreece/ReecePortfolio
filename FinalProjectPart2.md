## Draft Story in Shorthand
I used Shorthand to build a draft of my final project. I decided to create a draft as opposed to a wireframe or storyboard because 1) my "outline" in the [final project part I](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/FinalProjectPart1.html) assignment really turned into a wireframe, so I didn't feel the need to repeat the process, and; 2) I wanted to have some practice with Shorthand before it comes time to finalize my story. The Shorthand page includes draft data visualizations of the critical elements of my story, as well as accompanying text for each visualization. I know now, without having gathered any user feedback, that I will need to make changes to my current visualizations. However, they are effective enough at communicating the critical elements of my story, and thus are sufficient for the purpose of this exercise. 

**Click [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/child-care-access-in-california/index.html) to view my draft story in Shorthand.** This is the version I shared with users during the feedback process. 

## User Research & Interviews

### <u>Audience</u>
**Target audience:** Californians unfamiliar with the economic and social impacts of poor child care access.   

**Approach to identifying representative individuals**: Asking how familiar they are with the child care system, especially state-subsidized child care. I will also ask how familiar they are with the role that child care plays within the Californian economy. I'll ask these questions before scheduling interviews, meaning they are not included in the interview script outlined below.  

**General user descriptions:**
- User 1: Female law student in her mid 20's. Studying at a public university in the Bay Area. BA in Sociology. No kids and unfamiliar with the state's child care system. 
- User 2: Female elementary school teacher in her mid 50's. Lives in Riverside County. Raised 3 children who are now adults, but is unfamiliar with the state's child care system as she relied on family care when her children were young.
- User 3: Male tech employee in his mid 20's. Lives in San Francisco. BA in math and computer science. No kids and unfamiliar with the state's child care system.  

### <u>Research Goals & Questions</u>

| Goals     | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Intention | Can you describe: 1) the specific problem to be addressed?; 2) the proposed solution for the problem?; 3) how you as a reader fits into the solution? | 
| Comprehension | Was the overall flow clear? Were the data visualizations & supporting claims easy to understand? |
| Emotional Appeal | Did anything surprise you or cause a strong emotional response? Was the data compelling enough for you to move to action? Why or why not? |
| Improvement | Is there any additional info you wanted to learn about this topic? What did you find confusing? What would you change? |

### <u>Interview Script & Findings</u>

**Preface**: "I'm going to walk you through my draft for my final project for Telling Stories with Data. For context, the point of the project is to develop and present a narrative suitable for a subject audience for a selected topic that is clear, compelling and persuasive. The project should clearly construct and tell a story using various methods for explaining and presenting data."

*Then I'll walk users through the draft in Shorthand, briefly explaining each key element of the story including:*
- Title and brief description
- Why we should all care about child care access: 1) strong link to economy; 2) reduces future public spending; 3) child care supports the workforce of tomorrow; 4) it impacts more families than you think
- Why the current system isn't working: 1) child care cost as percent of income; 2) child care cost compared to college tuition; 3) more children need state subsidized child care; 4) but eligible children aren't getting access
- What you can do to help (call to action): 1) explain latest budget proposal; 2) explain budget process; 3) explain how to take action

*After the walk-through, I'll ask the following questions...*

| Questions | Findings  |
|-----------|-----------|
| Can you describe: 1) the specific problem to be addressed?; 2) the proposed solution for the problem?; 3) how you as a reader fits into the solution? | Responses were generally the same for part 1 & 2 of this question. Users accurately described the problem (child care affordability and/or access) and the solution (put more money towards the child care system by calling your representative). Answers varied for part 3. One user wasn't sure how they, as a person who doesn't plan to have children, fits into the solution. The other users felt they fit in as citizens with the ability to lobby their representative for more child care funding. |
| Was the overall flow clear? | One user got a little lost in the "child care impacts all of us" section, around the part explaining how child care relates to the greater economy. It's clear that child care impacts the economy, but how does the economy impact individual users? Other users found the headers ("Child care impacts all of us", "The current system is not working", etc.) to be helpful in outlining the overall flow/structure of the story. |
| Were the data visualizations & supporting claims easy to understand? | I received overall positive answers to this question, with the exception of a few specific charts. The infographic regarding 13% reduction in future spending was unclear. User comments included "13% of what?" and "Who is doing the saving?" The workforce chart felt meaningful after some verbal explanation, but it's not as immediately clear how it ties to the issue of child care access. How does a shrinking workforce imply we need more babies to succeed? The most positive remarks related to unit charts. Users thought those were very effective at showing what proportion of the population is impacted by child care access. | 
| Did anything surprise you or cause a strong emotional response? | Child care cost as a percent of income had a big impact, as did the university tuition bar chart. All users were fairly surprised and frustrated by those statistics. "Frustrated" meaning they were bothered by the fact that CA child care is so expensive relative to other states and other CA programs/services. |
| Was the data compelling enough for you to move to action? Why or why not? | The user who does not plan on having children was not moved to act, but said they might be if I fleshed out a stronger case in the "child care impacts all of us" section. One user mentioned their decision to take action on these sort of asks is often tied to the length of the story. If a story is too long or dense, with the call to action at the bottom of the page, they are less likely to act. With that in mind, they did not feel the story was too long, but could use a reduction in negative space in "the current system is not working" section. Another user recommended making the "find your representative" button more prominent so the call to action is more immediately obvious. |
| Is there any additional info you wanted to learn about this topic? | One user was not surprised to learn that child care -- like everything else -- is expensive in California. Their immediate first thought was "but Californians are all wealthy so they can afford it." That user would have liked to see more info about how child care costs impact low income communities and communities of color. Other users would like to see a clearer link between how investing in child care today improves future outcomes for kids, and how it closes the equity gap in those outcomes. |
| What did you find confusing? What would you change? | One user suggested adding state abbreviations to the tool tip of the Tableau map. Another re-emphasized the need for clarity in the "13%" infographic. The third would like the visualizations themselves to be a little bigger, and suggested I use a pie or donut chart instead of a bar chart to show the increase in children born into low income families. All users recommended using more simple, direct language, especially in the call to action section. | 

### <u>Plan on Changing</u>
Based on the findings outlined above, I plan to change the following elements for the final version of my project:
<ul>
<li>Child care access impacts all of us</li>
<ul>
<li>Add more context to the "13%" graphic, so it's clear who is doing the saving and where savings are being made.</li>
<li>I need to draw a clearer connection between a shrinking workforce and child care. I think I can accomplish this by reducing the text to a single, clear sentence explaining the connection, eliminating the other text that's currently included, and making the visualization bigger. The visualization will immediately follow the single sentence describing the connection between the future workforce and child care.</li>
<li>I'll try to find a dataset or stat that clearly connects the wellbeing of the economy to the wellbeing of individuals. This could be  represented with a conceptual visualization showing one concept leading to the next -- something along the lines of: **quality child care > better supported workforce > stronger economy > improved outcomes for all individuals in society**. I'm hoping a visual like that will make a stronger case for how child care access impacts people without children.</li>
<li>There was a little confusion related to the infographic showing 2/3 of 6 y/o's need child care. The main point of the visual wasn't immediately obvious. I'll try to improve that graphic by switching what text goes where -- I'll move the header language to the gray box and vice versa. I'll also simplify the language that was originally in the gray box, so the main point (2/3 of kids need child care access) is clear.</li>
</ul>  
<li>The current system is not working</li>
<ul>
<li>I'm going to play around with other chart types for the visual showing the percent of children born into low income families. I'm thinking either a pie chart or a donut chart, as one user suggested. I'm a little worried the data won't be compelling enough with a pie chart alone, since the percent only increased by 4 points from 2016 to 2019. I might try to make it more compelling by supplementing the pie chart with an infographic showing how 4% translates in terms of number of children.</li>
<li>I'm also going to try to make the map visualization larger if possible, and add the state abbreviations to the tool tip as one user suggested.</li>
<li>Indented item</li>
</ul>
<li>Call to action</li>
<ul>
<li>Reduce text and simplify language. I might incorporate some conceptual visualizations about the budget process to lighten the amount of text.</li>
<li>Increase size of the "find your rep" button if possible</li>
<li>Emphasize the "click the button" text in a way that doesn't involve changing the text color to blue. Users stated that the blue text made them think they could click on the text itself in order to take action, as opposed to clicking the button lower on the page. I still want to emphasize this text so it's clear what a user should do to take action, but I'll probably use bold or italicized font instead of changing the text color.</li>
</ul>
<li>General improvements to all sections</li>
<ul>
<li>Reduce text and simplify language throughout the entire story. I'll try to use more familiar terms and phrases. I know there are a few online tools that help you take complex language and simplify it to a level that a third grader, for example, could understand.</li>
<li>I've covered how child care relates to the economy and how expensive child care is. I'd like to also highlight why child care access is important for outcomes, and equity in outcomes. I'm not sure where that info best fits into the story. I'm leaning towards putting it right at the end of the "the current system is not working" section and before the call to action. I'm hoping a visual or graphic related to that topic will provoke a strong emotional response right before I ask the readers to contact their representatives.</li>
</ul>
