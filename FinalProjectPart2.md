- [Return to main portfolio page](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/)
- [Final Project Part I](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/FinalProjectPart1.html)
- [Final Project Part II](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/FinalProjectPart2.html)
- Final Project Part III (coming soon!)

## Draft Story in Shorthand
I used Shorthand to build a draft of my final project. I decided to create a draft as opposed to a wireframe or storyboard because 1) my "outline" in the [final project part I](https://ejreece.github.io/ReecePortfolio/FinalProjectPart1.html) assignment really turned into a wireframe, so I didn't feel the need to repeat the process, and; 2) I wanted to have some practice with Shorthand before it comes time to finalize my story. The Shorthand page includes draft data visualizations of the critical elements of my story, as well as accompanying text for each visualization. I know now, without having gathered any user feedback, that I will need to make changes to my current visualizations. However, they are effective enough at communicating the critical elements of my story, and thus are sufficient for the purpose of this exercise. 

**Click [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/child-care-access-in-california/index.html) to view my draft story in Shorthand.** This is the version I shared with users during the feedback process. 

## User Research & Interviews

### Audience
**Target audience:** Californians unfamiliar with the economic and social impacts of poor child care access.   

**Approach to identifying representative individuals**: Asking how familiar they are with the child care system, especially state-subsidized child care. I will also ask how familiar they are with the role that child care plays within the Californian economy. I'll ask these questions before scheduling interviews, meaning they are not included in the interview script outlined below.  

**General user descriptions:**
- User 1: Female law student in her mid 20's. Studying at a public university in the Bay Area. BA in Sociology. No kids and unfamiliar with the state's child care system. 
- User 2: Female elementary school teacher in her mid 50's. Lives in Riverside County. Raised 3 children who are now adults, but is unfamiliar with the state's child care system as she relied on family care when her children were young.
- User 3: Male tech employee in his mid 20's. Lives in San Francisco. BA in math and computer science. No kids and unfamiliar with the state's child care system.  

### Research Goals & Questions

| Goals     | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Intention | Can you describe: 1) the specific problem to be addressed?; 2) the proposed solution for the problem?; 3) how you as a reader fits into the solution? | 
| Comprehension | Was the overall flow clear? Were the data visualizations & supporting claims easy to understand? |
| Emotional Appeal | Did anything surprise you or cause a strong emotional response? Was the data compelling enough for you to move to action? Why or why not? |
| Improvement | Is there any additional info you wanted to learn about this topic? What did you find confusing? What would you change? |

### Interview Script & Findings

**Preface**: "I'm going to walk you through my draft for my final project for Telling Stories with Data. For context, the point of the project is to develop and present a narrative suitable for a subject audience for a selected topic that is clear, compelling and persuasive. The project should clearly construct and tell a story using various methods for explaining and presenting data."

*Then I'll walk users through the draft in Shorthand, briefly explaining each key element of the story including:*
- Title and brief description
- Why we should all care about child care access: 1) strong link to economy; 2) reduces future public spending; 3) child care supports the workforce of tomorrow; 4) it impacts more families than you think
- Why the current system isn't working: 1) child care cost as percent of income; 2) child care cost compared to college tuition; 3) more children need state subsidized child care; 4) but eligible children aren't getting access
- What you can do to help (call to action): 1) explain latest budget proposal; 2) explain budget process; 3) explain how to take action

*After the walk-through, I'll ask the following questions...*

### Plan on Changing
Based on the findings outlined above, I plan to change the following elements for the final version of my project:
