A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)

## The Audience
Who are they? How did I identify them?
What adjustments did I make to make it work for my audience?

## Narrowing the Focus
Insights from interviews and in-class critiques

## Design Decisions
Keep the color simple (blue)
Blue is gendered, however, when used without the contrast of pink I think folks are less likely to jump to gender norms
I stuck with blue mostly for aesthetic reasons -- aside from the associations with gender, I think it's generally neutral. It's easy to look at/read against light and dark backgrounds. I mainly chose it because it matched the few stock photos I chose to use in my project.

## What I Learned
