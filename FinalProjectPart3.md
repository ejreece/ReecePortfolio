## From Part II to Part III

Click [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/CDmUvITk9a2ldCV4) to view the Part III (final) version of my project. I reflect on the major changes between Part II and Part III in the paragraphs below.

## The Audience
The main audience for my project includes California residents who are unfamiliar with the state's child care system. Of that population, young people who plan on having kids are likely the easiest to "call to action" at the end of my story. Based on anecdotal evidence from user research, the tougher crowd will be young people who do not plan on having kids and thus likely will not have a need for child care in their lifetime. I made several adjustments from Part II to Part III -- specifically in the "child care impacts all of us" section -- in an attempt to better persuade that subgroup. For example, I added clarifications to the "13%" infographic, explicitly stating that investing in high quality early childhood programs reduces future *public* spending. I also drew a clearer connection between today's child care system and tomorrow's workforce with the addition of an infographic. The graphic shows a baby in 2021 who becomes a member of the workforce in 2060. This timeline parallels that of the accompanying line chart demonstrating the change in population estimates from today through 2060. 

## Narrowing the Focus
In Part II of the project, my proposed changes for Part III included drawing a clearer connection between economic and individual well-being, and highlighting why child care access is important for child outcomes. I ultimately decided *not* to implement these changes because I wanted to keep the focus of the project narrowed to three main points: 1) child care holds up the state's economy; 2) child care is overpriced in California; 3) not enough eligible children have access to state subsidized child care. My hope is that restricting focus to these three points keeps readers engaged without feelings overwhelmed by too much information. 

## Design Decisions
In terms of design decisions, I used only one main color (light blue) as a way to highlight key pieces of information throughout the story. Sticking to one color, in my opinion, makes the use of that color more meaningful, and is more aesthetically pleasing. The consistent use of a single color makes the project feel like it has an intentional theme or thread running through the entire story. While light blue is typically gendered, especially when talking about infants and toddlers, I think the audience will be less likely to jump to gender associations because I chose to use blue alone, not both blue and pink.

## What I Learned
Prior to taking this course and completing the final project, I often treated data visualizations as a last-minute and therefore less important part of course projects at Heinz. That practice was due to my tendency for procrastination, but also reflected the emphasis our society places on data analysis skills over design and communication skills. This course, Telling Stories with Data, has shown me that my ability to produce data visuals that are easily interpretable and aesthetically pleasing is *as important as* my ability to program in R or Python. I might even argue that the former skillset is more important than the latter. After all, what's the point of being able to run the best data analysis in the world if you don't know how to clearly visualize your findings for decision makers?
